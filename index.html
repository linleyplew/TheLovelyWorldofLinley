        <h3>Astrology</h3>

        <p>I have a lot of hobbies and interests. From cosmotology to, of course, computers. I love to learn new things. Im always on the quest for more knowledge. To better myself. Mentally and spiritually.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is studying Astrology. Theres so much to astrology than just the basic sun sign.</p>
        <p>A sun sign is what you would generally know based on the month you were born. (Libra, Gemini, Taurus, etc) </p>
        <p>However, when you were born, the exact time represents a snapshot of where all the planets were at that exact day/time. Those planets are a representation of you.</p>
        <p>Each planet has meaning. Such as your moon sign, which represents your inner self and emotions. Your mercury, how you learn. Your mars, how you assert yourself.</p>
        <p>If you would like to learn more about your birthchart, and thus get to know yourself  I'll provide a link to a helpful resource.</p>
        <p>You will need to know your:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>City of birth</li>
            <li>Exact time of birth</li>
            <li>And of course your date of birth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not know your exact time of birth, it may be on your birth certificate. Or you can ask your mother. Without it you can still get most of your birthchart. Just not all of it.</p>
        <p>I see astrology a lot like a personality test. Say for expample, the Myers-Briggs personality test.</p>
        <p>If you answer the questions honestly, these personality tests, and astrology alike can tell you a lot about yourself that sometimes we arent able to see for ourselves.</p>
